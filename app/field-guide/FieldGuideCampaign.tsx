    question: 'What does each supporter level include?',
    answer: 'Field Guide Supporter includes the complete 144-page PDF, a reflowable EPUB and a personal-use license. Founding Supporter also includes a separate printable worksheet pack and revised files released within Edition 1.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is this a physical book?',
    answer: 'No. Digital only; no physical shipment. Both supporter levels are digital rewards. Nothing is shipped.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between PDF and EPUB?',
    answer: 'The PDF preserves the designed 7 x 10 page experience. The EPUB reflows for adjustable text and compatible reading apps.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do secure downloads and re-access work?',
    answer: 'After payment is verified, supporters open a private access page for the files included with their level. Secure access links can expire; supporters can request fresh access.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I share the files?',
    answer: 'Personal use does not permit reposting or redistributing the files.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What do future revisions of Edition 1 mean?',
    answer: 'Founding Supporters receive revisions released within Edition 1. This does not include every future publication, a future Edition 2, lifetime support or a publication schedule.',

  {
    question: 'Is support tax-deductible?',
    answer: 'No. This is not charitable or tax-deductible support; it is an independent-publishing supporter reward.',

    question: 'Where can I find refund details or get in touch?',
    answer: 'Refund, privacy, terms and contact routes appear below when configured. Missing routes remain plain text while those policy decisions are being finalized.',
