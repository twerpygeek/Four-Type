      question: 'What is a Choleric temperament?',
      answer: 'The Choleric temperament is one of the four classical temperaments identified by Hippocrates over 2,500 years ago. The word "choleric" comes from Greek "cholē" meaning bile, as ancient physicians associated this temperament with yellow bile in the body\'s humoral system. Cholerics are characterized by ambition, decisiveness, and natural leadership ability. They are goal-oriented extroverts who excel at taking charge, driving results, and turning vision into reality. In the FourType system, we call them "The Commander" because of their commanding presence and strategic mind.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the main strengths of a Choleric personality?',
      answer: 'Cholerics possess powerful natural gifts: exceptional leadership abilities that inspire teams to achieve, efficiency in getting things done when others procrastinate, natural problem-solving skills that cut through complexity, strong willpower and focus that sustains effort over time, clear vision and direction that provides strategic clarity, and the ability to motivate teams through both challenge and example. They are the temperament most likely to start businesses, lead organizations, and drive transformational change.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What careers are best for Choleric temperaments?',
      answer: 'Cholerics excel in leadership-intensive careers with clear results and authority: executive leadership (CEO, COO positions), entrepreneurship (starting and scaling ventures), military and law enforcement (command roles), project management (driving complex initiatives), sales management (competitive environments), strategic planning (long-term vision work), politics (policy influence), and emergency services (high-stakes decision-making). They thrive where they can lead, decide, and see tangible results from their efforts.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do Cholerics behave in relationships?',
      answer: 'In relationships, Cholerics are protective, loyal, and action-oriented partners. They show love through providing, problem-solving, and taking charge of challenges. They appreciate partners who are confident, can handle direct communication, and don\'t need constant emotional reassurance. Best matches often include Phlegmatics (who provide peace and support their drive), Melancholics (who handle details they overlook), or other Cholerics (power couples with shared ambition). Their challenge is slowing down for emotional connection and not treating relationships like projects to manage.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the weaknesses of the Choleric temperament?',
      answer: 'Every temperament has growth areas. For Cholerics: appearing aggressive or domineering when passion for results overrides sensitivity, impatience with slower-paced people and processes, difficulty delegating (believing they can do it better themselves), struggling with empathy and emotional intelligence, workaholic tendencies leading to burnout and relationship neglect, and dismissing others\' input too quickly. Self-awareness and intentional humility help Cholerics grow into servant leaders rather than just commanders.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does a Choleric handle stress?',
      answer: 'Under stress, Cholerics may become more controlling, aggressive, or workaholic. They might micromanage, become short-tempered, or work longer hours instead of addressing root issues. Healthy coping strategies include: intense physical exercise (channeling aggressive energy), strategic problem-solving (breaking down overwhelming situations), learning to delegate and trust others, taking brief retreats to regain perspective, and building in non-negotiable rest. The key is recognizing when drive becomes destructive.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Choleric the same as Type A personality?',
      answer: 'While similar, they\'re not identical. Type A personality, developed by cardiologists Friedman and Rosenman, focuses primarily on competitiveness, urgency, and hostility—often as heart disease risk factors. The Choleric temperament encompasses broader leadership traits including decisiveness, goal-orientation, commanding presence, and strategic thinking. Many Type A individuals are indeed Choleric, but the temperament system provides deeper insights into motivation, relationships, and growth pathways that Type A doesn\'t address.',

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The Choleric temperament represents the driven achiever in humanity&apos;s personality spectrum. Named from the Greek &quot;cholē&quot; (bile), ancient physicians believed this temperament resulted from an excess of yellow bile, associating it with heat and dryness—fitting metaphors for the Choleric&apos;s burning ambition and decisive nature.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In modern personality psychology, Cholerics correlate with high extraversion and low agreeableness in the Big Five model—they&apos;re outgoing but don&apos;t prioritize pleasing others over achieving goals. They share characteristics with ENTJ and ESTJ types in Myers-Briggs. However, the temperament approach reveals unique insights about emotional patterns and interpersonal dynamics that other systems miss.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                What distinguishes Cholerics is their orientation toward results and control. While Sanguines are people-focused and Melancholics are task-quality focused, Cholerics are task-completion focused. They ask not &quot;Is everyone happy?&quot; or &quot;Is this perfect?&quot; but &quot;Is this done?&quot; This makes them indispensable in organizations that need to execute, but challenging in environments that require patience and consensus.
