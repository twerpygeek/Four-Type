    { question: 'What is a Melancholic temperament?', answer: 'The Melancholic temperament is one of the four classical temperaments identified by Hippocrates over 2,500 years ago. The word "melancholic" derives from Greek "melaina chole" meaning black bile, which ancient physicians believed produced this contemplative personality. Melancholics are characterized by analytical thinking, perfectionism, and deep introspection. They are introverted thinkers who excel at detailed work and maintain the highest standards. In the FourType system, we call them "The Strategist" because of their ability to see patterns, anticipate problems, and create comprehensive plans.' },
    { question: 'What are the main strengths of a Melancholic personality?', answer: 'Melancholics possess remarkable gifts: exceptional analytical skills that see what others miss, high-quality work output that sets industry standards, great attention to detail that catches errors, reliability and dependability that builds trust, deep emotional intelligence that understands nuance, and the ability to create comprehensive plans and thorough research. They are often the quality control of any organization—the people who ensure things are done right, not just done.' },
    { question: 'What careers are best for Melancholic temperaments?', answer: 'Melancholics excel in careers requiring precision, depth, and quality: research and science (systematic investigation), software development (complex code, attention to detail), accounting and finance (precision with numbers), academic careers (deep expertise), quality assurance (finding flaws), writing and journalism (careful research), psychology and counseling (deep empathy), and engineering (systematic problem-solving). They thrive where depth matters more than speed.' },
    { question: 'How do Melancholics behave in relationships?', answer: 'In relationships, Melancholics are deeply loyal, thoughtful partners who show love through acts of service, quality time, and remembering important details. They take time to open up but form profound bonds once trust is established. They need partners who respect their need for alone time and deep conversation over small talk. Best matches often include Phlegmatics (peaceful stability), Sanguines (balance their seriousness), or other Melancholics (shared depth). Their challenge is expressing emotions openly and not withdrawing when hurt.' },
    { question: 'What are the weaknesses of the Melancholic temperament?', answer: 'Every temperament has growth areas. For Melancholics: being overly critical of self and others (the inner critic never rests), perfectionism that paralyzes action (waiting for perfect conditions), difficulty delegating (no one meets their standards), social withdrawal (preferring solitude over connection), anxiety and overthinking (analyzing every possibility), slow decision-making (more data is always needed), and appearing pessimistic (seeing problems others miss). Self-compassion and intentional action help Melancholics grow.' },
    { question: 'How does a Melancholic handle stress?', answer: 'Under stress, Melancholics may become withdrawn, overly critical, anxious, or pessimistic. They might isolate themselves, engage in negative self-talk, or become paralyzed by perfectionism. Healthy coping strategies include: structured problem-solving (breaking down overwhelming situations), creative outlets (art, music, writing), talking with trusted confidants, physical exercise, setting "good enough" standards, and practices that break overthinking cycles like mindfulness or journaling. The key is moving from analysis to action.' },
    { question: 'Is Melancholic the same as being depressed?', answer: 'No, despite the similar-sounding name. The Melancholic temperament is not depression—it\'s a personality type characterized by thoughtfulness, depth, and high standards. While Melancholics may be more prone to negative emotions due to their reflective nature and awareness of imperfection, the temperament itself is not a mental health condition. Many highly successful artists, scientists, and thinkers throughout history have been Melancholic. That said, Melancholics should be aware of their tendency toward negative thinking and seek support when needed.' },

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">The Melancholic temperament represents the thoughtful analyst in humanity&apos;s personality spectrum. Named from Greek &quot;melaina chole&quot; (black bile), ancient physicians believed this temperament resulted from this bodily humor, associating it with earth, coldness, and dryness—fitting metaphors for the Melancholic&apos;s grounded, measured approach to life.</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">In modern personality psychology, Melancholics correlate with high conscientiousness and neuroticism (emotional sensitivity) in the Big Five model. They share characteristics with INTJ and INFJ types in Myers-Briggs. However, the temperament approach reveals unique insights about their perfectionism patterns and emotional depth that other systems often miss.</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">What distinguishes Melancholics is their orientation toward quality and meaning. While Sanguines ask &quot;Is this fun?&quot; and Cholerics ask &quot;Is this done?&quot; Melancholics ask &quot;Is this right?&quot; This makes them invaluable in any endeavor requiring excellence, but challenging in environments that prioritize speed over substance.</p>
