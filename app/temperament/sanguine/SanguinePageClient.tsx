      question: 'What is a Sanguine temperament?',
      answer: 'The Sanguine temperament is one of the four classical temperaments first identified by Hippocrates over 2,500 years ago. Characterized by enthusiasm, optimism, and social magnetism, Sanguines are the extroverts of the temperament world. They thrive on human connection, love new experiences, and bring infectious energy to everything they do. In the FourType system, we call them "The Bard" because of their natural storytelling abilities and charismatic presence.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the main strengths of a Sanguine personality?',
      answer: 'Sanguines possess remarkable natural gifts: they\'re excellent communicators who can captivate any audience, skilled networkers who build relationships effortlessly, creative thinkers who generate innovative solutions, and natural motivators who inspire those around them. Their adaptability means they handle change better than most temperaments, and their optimism helps teams push through challenges. They\'re often the emotional glue that holds groups together.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What careers are best for Sanguine temperaments?',
      answer: 'Sanguines excel in careers that combine people interaction with creativity and variety. Top choices include: sales and marketing (using natural persuasion), entertainment and media (comfortable in the spotlight), event planning (thriving in dynamic environments), public relations (building relationships), teaching (engaging students), hospitality (creating welcoming experiences), and creative industries (channeling endless ideas). Leadership roles that require inspiring others are also excellent fits.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do Sanguines behave in relationships?',
      answer: 'In relationships, Sanguines are warm, affectionate, and fun-loving partners who keep things exciting. They express love through quality time, words of affirmation, and spontaneous gestures. However, they may struggle with consistency in daily routines and deep emotional conversations that require patience. They need partners who appreciate their social nature and give them freedom to maintain friendships. The best matches often include Phlegmatics (who provide stability) or other Sanguines (who share their zest for life).',
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the weaknesses of the Sanguine temperament?',
      answer: 'Every temperament has growth areas. For Sanguines, common challenges include: impulsivity (acting before thinking), difficulty maintaining long-term focus (distracted by new opportunities), struggles with detail-oriented tasks (preferring big-picture thinking), tendency to overcommit (saying yes to everything), and sometimes being perceived as shallow (prioritizing breadth over depth in relationships). Self-awareness and intentional discipline help Sanguines grow past these limitations.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does a Sanguine handle stress?',
      answer: 'Under stress, Sanguines may become scattered, overly talkative, or seek distraction through social activities and entertainment. They might avoid dealing with problems directly, hoping issues will resolve themselves. Healthy coping strategies include: talking through problems with trusted friends, channeling stress into creative projects, maintaining some routine structure, and breaking overwhelming tasks into smaller social-friendly chunks. Physical activity and laughter are powerful stress relievers for this temperament.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between Sanguine and Choleric temperaments?',
      answer: 'While both Sanguines and Cholerics are extroverted and energetic, they differ fundamentally in focus. Sanguines are people-focused—they seek connection, fun, and shared experiences. Cholerics are task-focused—they seek achievement, results, and control. Sanguines inspire through enthusiasm and charisma; Cholerics lead through decisive action and clear direction. Sanguines ask "Who\'s coming?" while Cholerics ask "What\'s the goal?" Understanding these differences helps these two temperaments work together effectively.',

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The Sanguine temperament represents one of humanity&apos;s oldest personality classifications, 
                dating back to the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates around 400 BCE. The word &quot;sanguine&quot; 
                derives from the Latin &quot;sanguis,&quot; meaning blood, as ancient physicians believed this 
                temperament was associated with an abundance of blood in the body&apos;s humoral balance.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In modern personality psychology, the Sanguine type correlates strongly with high extraversion 
                and high openness to experience in the Big Five model. They share characteristics with ENFP 
                and ESFP types in the Myers-Briggs system. However, the temperament approach offers unique 
                insights that other systems miss—particularly around emotional patterns, stress responses, 
                and interpersonal dynamics that have been observed consistently for millennia.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                What makes Sanguines truly distinctive is their emotional responsiveness and social orientation. 
                They experience emotions quickly and intensely but also move through them rapidly. A Sanguine 
                can be genuinely upset one moment and laughing the next—not because they&apos;re shallow, but 
                because their emotional processing style is fundamentally different from other temperaments.
