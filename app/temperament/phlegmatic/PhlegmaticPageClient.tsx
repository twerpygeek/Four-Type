    { question: 'What is a Phlegmatic temperament?', answer: 'The Phlegmatic temperament is one of the four classical temperaments identified by Hippocrates over 2,500 years ago. The word "phlegmatic" derives from Greek "phlegma" meaning phlegm, which ancient physicians believed produced this calm personality. Phlegmatics are characterized by peacefulness, loyalty, and a supportive disposition. They are introverted supporters who excel at creating harmony, maintaining stability, and building deep, lasting relationships. In the FourType system, we call them "The Guardian" because of their protective, nurturing nature.' },
    { question: 'What are the main strengths of a Phlegmatic personality?', answer: 'Phlegmatics possess remarkable gifts: exceptional listening skills that make others feel truly heard, natural ability to create peaceful environments, outstanding loyalty and dependability that builds trust, talent for mediation and conflict resolution, steady and consistent work output that others rely on, and the ability to remain calm under pressure when others panic. They are often the emotional anchors of their families and teams—the people who hold everything together.' },
    { question: 'What careers are best for Phlegmatic temperaments?', answer: 'Phlegmatics excel in careers requiring patience, interpersonal skills, and steady reliability: human resources (building positive cultures), counseling and therapy (patient listening), nursing and healthcare (calm, caring presence), social work (compassionate advocacy), teaching (nurturing environments), administrative roles (reliable organization), customer service (patient problem-solving), and team coordination (natural facilitation). They thrive where stability matters more than speed.' },
    { question: 'How do Phlegmatics behave in relationships?', answer: 'In relationships, Phlegmatics are deeply loyal, supportive partners who create stable, harmonious environments. They show love through consistent presence, acts of service, and unwavering support. They need time to open up but form unbreakable bonds once trust is established. Best matches often include Cholerics (balancing action with peace), Sanguines (adding energy to their calm), or other Phlegmatics (shared tranquility). Their challenge is expressing their own needs and not suppressing emotions.' },
    { question: 'What are the weaknesses of the Phlegmatic temperament?', answer: 'Every temperament has growth areas. For Phlegmatics: being overly passive (waiting instead of acting), difficulty making decisions (fearing the wrong choice), lack of initiative (needing external motivation), resistance to change (preferring familiar routines), suppressing their own needs (prioritizing others\' comfort), avoiding conflict to an unhealthy degree (letting problems fester), and struggling with assertiveness (not speaking up). Intentional action and self-advocacy help Phlegmatics grow.' },
    { question: 'How does a Phlegmatic handle stress?', answer: 'Under stress, Phlegmatics may become withdrawn, stubborn, or passive-aggressive. They might internalize problems rather than addressing them, leading to hidden resentment that eventually surfaces. Healthy coping strategies include: gentle exercise like walking or yoga, time in nature (restorative and calming), talking with trusted confidants (one-on-one), structured problem-solving at their own pace, setting small boundaries to prevent overwhelm, and journaling to process emotions. The key is addressing issues before resentment builds.' },
    { question: 'What is the difference between Phlegmatic and Melancholic temperaments?', answer: 'While both Phlegmatics and Melancholics are introverted, they differ fundamentally in orientation. Phlegmatics seek harmony and stability—they want peaceful relationships and consistent environments. Melancholics seek perfection and depth—they want things done right and ideas explored thoroughly. Phlegmatics are relationship-oriented; Melancholics are task-oriented. Phlegmatics ask "Is everyone okay?" while Melancholics ask "Is this correct?" Understanding these differences helps these two temperaments appreciate each other.' },

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">The Phlegmatic temperament represents the peaceful stabilizer in humanity&apos;s personality spectrum. Named from Greek &quot;phlegma&quot; (phlegm), ancient physicians believed this temperament resulted from this bodily humor, associating it with water, coldness, and moisture—fitting metaphors for the Phlegmatic&apos;s calm, adaptable, and nurturing approach to life.</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">In modern personality psychology, Phlegmatics correlate with high agreeableness and emotional stability in the Big Five model. They share characteristics with ISFJ and INFP types in Myers-Briggs. However, the temperament approach reveals unique insights about their loyalty patterns and conflict-avoidance tendencies that other systems often miss.</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">What distinguishes Phlegmatics is their orientation toward harmony and relationships. While Cholerics ask &quot;What needs to be done?&quot; and Sanguines ask &quot;Who&apos;s coming?&quot; Phlegmatics ask &quot;Is everyone okay?&quot; This makes them invaluable in any endeavor requiring teamwork, but challenging in environments that require rapid change or aggressive competition.</p>
