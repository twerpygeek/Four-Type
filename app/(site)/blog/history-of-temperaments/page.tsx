          <h2 className="font-serif">Ancient Greece: Where It All Began</h2>

          <h3 className="font-serif">Empedocles and the Four Elements (c. 490–430 BC)</h3>
          <p>
            Before there were temperaments, there were elements. The Greek philosopher Empedocles proposed that all 
            matter was made up of four fundamental elements: earth, water, air, and fire. This idea of four basic 
            building blocks of nature became the philosophical foundation for everything that followed.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-serif">Hippocrates and the Four Humors (c. 460–370 BC)</h3>
          <p>
            Hippocrates — often called the "father of medicine" — took Empedocles idea and applied it to the human 
            body. He proposed that health and personality were governed by the balance of four bodily fluids, 
            called humors:
          </p>

          <div className="not-prose my-8 grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {[
              { humor: 'Blood', element: 'Air', traits: 'Warm, moist, social, optimistic', color: '#FFD700' },

              { humor: 'Black Bile', element: 'Earth', traits: 'Cold, dry, analytical, melancholic', color: '#4CC9F0' },
              { humor: 'Phlegm', element: 'Water', traits: 'Cold, moist, calm, sluggish', color: '#52B788' },
            ].map((item) => (
              <div 
                key={item.humor}
                className="p-4 rounded-xl bg-card border border-border"
                style={{ borderLeftColor: item.color, borderLeftWidth: '3px' }}
              >

              </div>
            ))}
          </div>

          <p>
            When the humors were in balance, a person was healthy. When one dominated, it shaped both physical 
            health and personality. This humoral theory was a unified model of body and mind — something modern 
            medicine has only recently begun to re-explore through psychoneuroimmunology.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-serif">Galen and the Four Temperaments (c. 129–216 AD)</h3>
          <p>
            The Roman physician Galen took Hippocrates humoral theory and formalized the connection between humor 
            dominance and personality type. He gave us the names we still use today: <strong>Sanguine</strong> (blood-dominant), 
            <strong>Choleric</strong> (yellow bile-dominant), <strong>Melancholic</strong> (black bile-dominant), and 
            <strong>Phlegmatic</strong> (phlegm-dominant).

          <div className="not-prose my-8 p-6 rounded-xl bg-primary/5 border border-primary/20">
            <p className="text-foreground">
              <strong className="text-primary">Key insight:</strong> Crucially, Galen recognized that most people are 
              blends of two or more temperaments — not pure types. This insight was remarkably modern and anticipated 
              the trait-continuum models that would not arrive for another 1,700 years.
            </p>

          <h2 className="font-serif">The Medieval Period: Preservation and Expansion</h2>

          <h3 className="font-serif">Islamic Golden Age (8th–14th centuries)</h3>
          <p>
            When much of European learning was lost during the early medieval period, Islamic scholars preserved and 
            expanded Greek medical knowledge. Physicians like Avicenna (The Canon of Medicine, c. 1025) refined humoral 
            theory and integrated it with their own observations. Avicenna work was used as a medical textbook in both 
            Islamic and European universities for centuries.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-serif">The Enlightenment: Temperament Meets Philosophy</h2>

          <h3 className="font-serif">Immanuel Kant (1724–1804)</h3>
          <p>
            Kant made a pivotal distinction in his Anthropology From a Pragmatic Point of View (1798): he separated 
            <em>physical temperament</em> (bodily constitution) from <em>psychological temperament</em> (personality patterns). 
            For the first time, temperament was framed as a pattern of feeling and activity rather than a consequence of 
            fluid imbalances.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-serif">The Birth of Modern Psychology</h2>

          <h3 className="font-serif">Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920)</h3>
          <p>
            Wundt — widely regarded as the father of experimental psychology — completed Kant work by fully separating 
            temperament from body fluids. He placed the four temperaments on two independent, measurable axes:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Emotionality:</strong> How strongly and quickly do you react emotionally? (Strong vs. Weak)</li>
            <li><strong>Changeability:</strong> How quickly do your emotions and interests shift? (Changeable vs. Stable)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This created a clean 2×2 matrix that anticipated the Big Five and every two-axis personality model that followed.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-serif">The 20th Century: Temperament Goes Mainstream</h2>

          <h3 className="font-serif">Hans Eysenck (1916–1997)</h3>
          <p>
            British psychologist Eysenck explicitly connected the four temperaments to his own dimensional model of 
            personality in Dimensions of Personality (1947). He mapped them onto two factors: <strong>Extraversion</strong> 
            and <strong>Neuroticism</strong>. The four quadrants of Eysenck model correspond directly to the four 
            temperaments — and his work heavily influenced the Big Five (OCEAN) model that dominates academic psychology today.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-serif">David Keirsey (1921–2013)</h3>
          <p>
            In Please Understand Me (1978), Keirsey bridged the ancient and the modern by mapping the four temperaments 
            onto the 16 Myers-Briggs personality types. His framework brought temperament theory into corporate training, 
            career counseling, and educational settings — contexts where it continues to thrive today.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-serif">Today: The Temperaments in Modern Life</h2>

          <p>
            The four temperaments are alive and well in the 21st century, though they often go by different names:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>DISC (the dominant workplace behavioral assessment) maps almost 1:1 to the four temperaments</li>
            <li>Personality quizzes on social media frequently use temperament-based frameworks</li>
            <li>Coaching and therapy increasingly use temperament as a tool for self-understanding</li>
            <li>Education continues to apply temperament principles, especially in Waldorf and Montessori-influenced schools</li>
            <li>Neuroscience is exploring whether the temperaments map onto neurotransmitter profiles</li>
          </ul>
